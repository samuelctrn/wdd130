    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p> I'm 26 years old, was born in Brazil in 1996, I have been a member of The church of Jesus Christ of 
        Latter-Day Saints for the last eight years, i've learned a lot in this time, also, I was a full-time missionary in Colombia from 2016 to 2018, where I learned main spiritual principles that guides my personal life even until today. I am going for a Technology systems degree, but I also want to learn more about Data bank and Support. My main hobbies are bike traveling and going to the temple, that's what brings me more peace. I am single and I have no children, yet! That is surely part of my plans, I work as a Help Desk Trilingual attendant, I have been working in construction for my whole life, but always trying to get a new job in another different area than the one i've been working on since forever.
    <h3>What do I think about BYU?</h3>
        What I love the most about BYU is the opportunity I have of learning and growing in a supportive enviroment and surrounded with people who shares the same values and faith, also, I know people are really respectful. I think that everything realted to computers and technology are the future, we can clearly see it nowadays, how usually veteran jobs are being replaced by AI commanded programs, I believe that in a close future, those who are able to control and create this technology will have much more advantage to set this world on, and also a great knowledge in the afterlife.
